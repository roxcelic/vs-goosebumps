# hii,

So to everyone reading this Hey, I love goosebumps. Maybe to an unreasonable amount (who knows)
but i noticed there wasnt any themes for it on the Vs code marketplace and yeah maybe thats for a reason
who wants a theme based on an old 90s show? Me, I do. So here we are.

* what you need to know:
    - credits for the goosebumps icon go to Scholastic Corporation. (i found the image on google so take it with a grain of salt)
    - credits for the goosebumps name gose to Scholastic Corporation.
    - this probably wont be receiving updates as frequently as my other creations (probably none at all)
    - ## for marketplace viewers
    - if you would like to check out more things ive made check out my [github](https://github.com/roxcelic)
    - if you would like to checkout the git repo for this come to [here](https://github.com/roxcelic/themes)

## extra info,

* This theme contains:
    - goosebumps (light)
    - goosebumps (dark)

If there is any reason youd need to contact me feel free to dm me on discord @roxcelic

Thank you for using my theme ^^
